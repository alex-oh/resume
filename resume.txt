Engineering Experience
=================================================================================================
Bose Corporation, Framingham, MA
Consumer Electronics Mechanical Engineering Co-op	January 2018 – June 2018
o	Pushed exploration phase product to first physical prototyping build as member of wireless headphones team
o	Designed test fixtures with NX 11 using iterative design process, considering DFX methodologies (DFM, DFA)
o	Utilized makerspace while prototyping fixtures – made extensive use of machine shop, Form 2 SLA 3D-printer, Epilog laser cutter
o	Performed mechanical, usability testing with cross-product eartip that influenced future design iterations
o	Earned Bose Lean Enterprise Yellow Belt Certification
Northeastern University Rehabilitation Games & Virtual Reality Laboratory, Boston, MA
Project Assistant	September 2017 – Dec 2017
o	Provided electromechanical support for Robots Encouraging Action in Children (REACH) system
o	Performed hardware integration with a wireless robotic arm module coding with Arduino IDE
Analogic Corporation, Peabody, MA
Manufacturing Engineering Co-op	January 2017 – June 2017
o	Assembled pre-production stage components prior to existence of procedures for flagship airport checkpoint security CT scanner and 1st generation medical CT scanner
o	Prepared technical drawings with proper GD&T callouts using SOLIDWORKS 
o	Developed and revised new manufacturing procedures that were implemented shortly after creation, considerably improving ease of construction and efficiency
o	Trained engineering technicians to build newly designed subassemblies
o	Updated Bills of Materials by filing ECO’s, allowing for improved ease of assembly 

Projects
o	Modeled a Bb trumpet with Autodesk Fusion 360 for “Design for Autodesk Challenge”
o	Designed ergonomic fixture block that makes one-handed trumpet playing less physically taxing
?	Worked with a local Boston trumpet player through multi-stage iterative design process
o	In progress: “Electronic Valve Instrument” synthesizer design with a fellow mechanical engineering student
?	Goal – design a playable synthesizer with ergonomic, easy-to-assemble design
